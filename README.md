# 🧹 Monster.com Job Listings – Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on **data cleaning** using Python and Pandas.  
The dataset contains 22,000 job listings scraped from Monster.com.

## 🔧 What I Did
- Removed duplicate rows
- Cleaned and split messy `location` fields into `city`, `state`, and `zip_code`
- Handled missing and inconsistent salary data
- Extracted numeric salary ranges and standardized them (e.g., hourly to yearly)

## 📁 Files
- `data/raw_jobs.csv` – Raw dataset
- `clean_monster_jobs.py` – Python script for cleaning

## 🚧 Project Status

Still in progress — salary parsing logic is being refined.  
This is a learning project focused on mastering the **core of data work: cleaning**.

## ✅ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Regex

## 💡 Why This Project?
Because **clean data is everything.**  
Before analysis or machine learning, you need good data.  
This project is a hands-on practice in the most essential skill for any data analyst or data scientist.
